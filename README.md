## DRUM-Compatible Model and Environment

### Introduction
This repository comprises 2 folders. The first folder, called 'environment', contains the Docker context files required to create a Docker environment that would be used to test the created model. This environment would subsequently be uploaded to DataRobot. The second folder, called 'model', contains a few files (including the necessary custom.py and .h5 model files) that are required for the creation of a DRUM-compatible model.

Note that DRUM requires a Linux environment. If on Windows, use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

### DRUM-Compatible Environment
Most of the files inside wouldn't need to be changed.

#### environment/requirements.txt
If there are any additional dependencies that aren't covered in the 'environment/requirements.txt' file, add them before continuing.

### DRUM-Compatible Model

#### custom.py
This file was autogenerated using a DRUM utility, and essentially came with a few supported, commented-out functions that can be used with DRUM. Input data streams can be manipulated and converted to a desired file type. There is no real file type restriction, as long as you are able to pass it through in bytes and save it somewhere.

#### .h5 model file
This is the model file. The logic for loading this file is inside one of the hooks in custom.py

### Use

Run the following command to run the model using DRUM inside a Docker environment that DRUM creates using the Docker context files provided in the Environment/ folder:

```drum server --code-dir model/ --positive-class-label 1 --negative-class-label 0 --target-type binary --address localhost:6789 --docker environment/```

#### positive-class and negative-class
Should correspond with the format of the output predictions that are being rendered

#### address
The port number can be anything, just avoid commonly used ones like 443, 80, etc.

#### --docker
Specifies the location of the Docker context files. Alternatively, you could build a Docker image and specify the location of the tarball
